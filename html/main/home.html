       As a former owner and primary hypnotist at Baltimore Hypnosis Center, I have years of experience in Hypnotic modalities and other holistic and mindfulness modalities.  As a Board Certified Hypnotist (2007) from the National Guild of Hypnotist (NGH), I follow the standards and ethics. I have the knowledge and experience to help you with whatever issue you would like to overcome, whether it be a long struggle with addiction, losing stubborn weight, finally getting rid of cigarettes, or whatever issue you would like to overcome.  As a practitioner of the 5-PATH process of hypnosis, I use a structured model which starts with laying the foundation and making sure my client is hypnotized and that the groundwork is laid, then transitions to a thorough method of using the subconscious mind to overcome the problem, a process that is thorough so you can experience the change you desire.  As you continue to read my site, you will find more information on Hypnosis, NLP, CBT, DBT, and Mindfulness.  By having a grasp on a range of modalities, it allows me a wide range of tools to assist my clients.

       Issues with Traditional Treatment: Breaking the Cycle
      </h2>
      <p>
       Traditional treatment methods, particularly the cycle of Rehab followed by Twelve Step Meetings, prove to be a daunting treadmill. Many addicts, after numerous treatments, find themselves locked into a singular approach. The prevalent emphasis on the Twelve Step / AA / NA process in many Rehab centers often leaves individuals feeling trapped, as if there's no other way to achieve sobriety.

      </div>
      <p>
       Thankfully, there exist alternative paths to sobriety. One such transformative approach is SMART Recovery. This method focuses on empowering individuals through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), Motivational Interviewing, and Mindfulness. Unlike traditional Twelve Step programs, SMART Recovery emphasizes self-empowerment and does not mandate submission to a higher power. Participants are equipped with practical tools to combat cravings, develop healthier thought patterns, and engage in positive activities.

       The Power of Hypnosis: Unraveling Subconscious Patterns
      </h2>
      <p>
       Hypnosis stands as a potent tool in the journey of addiction recovery. A skilled hypnotist, well-versed in a myriad of modalities, can effectively coach clients into discovering and resolving hidden patterns driving addictive behaviors. Unlike traditional approaches, hypnosis engages the client's subconscious mind, delving into the vast reservoir of their knowledge and experiences. It uncovers subconscious drivers that often lie beyond conscious awareness. Traditional methods, reliant on conscious reasoning, often fall short because the roots of addiction develop long before symptoms manifest. Merely talking about the problem is insufficient; effective hypnotherapy allows the subconscious mind to construct solutions to the addiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I strongly urge you to explore hypnosis as a modality for your recovery. With proper guidance, your subconscious mind can illuminate a path through your struggles far more effectively than traditional methods.

       I have to admit that I was a skeptic of Astrology for a long time.  As a Libra I really never felt like a Libra.  Libras were the social butterflies, they love art and beauty, the common things people think of when they think about Libra.  But a social butterfly and art buff I wasn't.  It wasn't until many years later I found out that Libra is just my Sun sign and that's only one small piece of a larger puzzle that makes up one's Natal Chart or Birth Chart if you like.  I never knew what a Rising/Ascendant Sign was and how much this plays into one's personality.  The way I explain it the Rising/Ascendant Sign is like the kind of car you drive, and your Sun sign is like the driver.  The Rising Sign is what people's first impression of you is, and your Sun sign is your ego, or what you strive to be.  For me finding out what my whole birth chart was made of clarified things and things started to ring true.  My Rising sign is Capricorn and my Sun Sign is Libra so in a nutshell they both clash so my Libra extraversion is muted by my Capricorn practicality, the way I express my art/beauty is through my that I always like my business surroundings and dealings to be beautiful, and nice.  And that's just going on two placements.  There are a whole host of placements that make up one's birth chart.  From my continuing reading of Birth Charts I have found that Astrology actually becomes pretty accurate when you are able to view the whole picture.

       The Power of Placements:
      </h2>
      <p>
       Your Natal Chart consists of numerous placements — each governing a unique aspect of your life. From Mercury, guiding your mind and learning, to Mars, defining your approach to challenges, these placements provide profound insights. And then there are the house placements, reflecting responses in different areas of life — from ego to leisure and everything in between. It's a holistic view that accurately describes a person, far beyond what a simple Sun Sign could reveal.

       My facination with technology began in child with my introduction to the Atari 800XL (an Atari 8-bit Computer).
            I spent endless hours reading manuals, books, and learning about computers, even delving into programming with BASIC.

       As I grew older, my first x86 system was a Tandy computer, an IBM XT clone. 
            It was from there that I began my journey of building and upgrading PCs. 
            I relished the challenge of assembling motherboards, inserting video cards, and configuring hard drives – each new piece of hardware was an opportunity for exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Around sixth grade, my fascination with executable files led me to the realm of C programming. 
            I became a frequent visitor to the library, poring over books like Kernighan &amp; Ritchie's "The C Programming Language." 
            Armed with this newfound knowledge, I embarked on a journey of creating my own programs.  Additionaly, being a SysOp of the "Black Cross BBS" in Baltimore, MD I was able to expand on my knowledge and skills with the C programming language.
            As my BBS was running WWIV, the C source code was distributed with it, modification of the source code to customize one's BBS was a common practice.  
            I was fourinate to be able to be a modemer back in the early 90's before the internet became prevlant, it was a unique experience which lended a lot to the development of my early technical skills and created friendships along the way.   
            BBSing in the 90s created a unique local camaraderie which hasn't been well duplicated with the internet.

       Additionally, the impressive feats of the demo scene of the early 90's, with groups such as Future Crew captured my interests.  Seeing the impressive technicnal feats that they were able to pull off inspired me to tackle learing the x86 assembly language.

       Professional Journey in IT
      </h2>
      <p>
       My career in IT officially began in February 1995 with an internship at Allied Signal Aerospace. This opportunity marked the start of a diverse and enriching career that exposed me to various IT roles, from system administration and engineering to software development and data center management. I navigated the evolution of operating systems, from UNIX flavors like Sun OS and HPUX to different Linux distributions and Windows Servers. Throughout my journey, fundamental tools like vi remained constants, even as technologies changed.

       As the internet emerged, I delved into web technologies. I started with PERL CGI for web pages and witnessed the evolution of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. My skills adapted to the changing landscape, enabling me to create websites and web applications. I transitioned through various languages, with Python, Ruby, and BASH scripting on Linux, and PowerShell and .NET (C#) for Windows tasks becoming my mainstays.

       I enjoy creating from scratch, evident in this website. All elements, include the HTML, CSS and Javascript are my own creation.
            While I could have used Bootstrap or React, I wanted my site to be my own creation and have it's own unique look.
            On the back end I leverage Python script to help me maintain the pages on this site and to keep everything together.  
            Aside from just the website, I have my own tools developed to help me maintain the day to day of my business and other's in mind to be developed in the future.
            I will be polishing these tools and selling them tools as services to be used for other business for alternatives to manage the business side of things like client scheduling,
            appointment reminders (texting or calling clients) and many more.
