       10 Ways Hypnosis Can Help You Lose Weight by Adam Fistler, BCH
      </h1>

      <p>
       Maybe you heard that hypnosis can help you lose weight easily but you never quite understood how. You only heard vague notions that hypnosis could help you lose weight but never really knew what hypnosis could do for you. Below is a list of ten things hypnosis can do to help you easily get rid of weight and keep it off.
      </p>
      <h2>
       10. Eliminate Amnesic Eating (Mindless Eating)
      </h2>
      <p>
       I've help a lot of clients lose weight, and one factor that is over looked is what I like to call amnesic eating. Amnesic eating is the little snacks grabbed here and there that people just simply forget they ate during the day. In fact if you were to go back over the course of the last couple of weeks I'm sure you could find things that you've had to eat which you totally forgot about. In most of the times when people eat these things, they really don't matter to that person. That person wouldn't have cared one way or the other if they would have eaten it or not. Worrying now about eating those things won't help you, but if you could have gone back and not eaten them, this could make a difference. Hypnosis can help you eliminate this amnesic eating.
      </p>
      <div class="content-img right">
       <img alt="Clean Your Plate" src="/img/articles/hypnosis/10_things_weight_loss/clean_your_plate.png"/>
      </div>
      <h2>
       9. Remove Guilt for Not Cleaning Your Plate
      </h2>
      <p>
       Lots of times people get the message early on that they should clean their plate because there are starving people in the world. I'm sure when your parents told you that their message was not to waste food, not eat a lot and become overweight. Using hypnotic techniques we can help you with both being OK with pushing away after you are satisfied and with controlling the amount of food you take in the first place.
      </p>
      <h2>
       8. Remove Hunger Triggers
      </h2>
      <p>
       Whether you are aware of it or not, there are also triggers than can make you feel hunger. Back a long time ago a doctor by the name of Ivan Pavlov discovered that every time he rang a bell, his dogs would begin to salivate. He found that ringing the bell in close proximity to delving food caused the dogs to associate the bell with eating. People can do much the same thing. Doing things such as eating in front of the TV can cause you to feel hungry every time you sit in front of the TV. Or perhaps just by driving by certain stores can cause you to feel hungry. We can help you identify these triggers and use hypnotic suggestion to remove them.
      </p>
      <h2>
       7. Reduce Over Eating and Binging
      </h2>
      <p>
       Most of the time, over eating and binging are a method of distracting from an emotion. These are what sometimes are called coping behaviors. Instead of facing the emotion sometimes people binge to prevent them self from experiencing an emotion. We know that there is no amount of food that can ever satisfy an emotion. However we can help you neutralize the feelings that are causing the behaviors thus eliminating the behaviors.
      </p>
      <div class="content-img right">
       <img alt="Will Power Fails In The End" src="/img/articles/hypnosis/10_things_weight_loss/anti_will_power.png" style="height: 175px; width: 185px;"/>
      </div>
      <h2>
       6. End Internal Conflict
      </h2>
      <p>
       We would all like to use will power to help us lose weight. However will power is exactly the wrong tool to use. Will power only stays with us as long as we want what we committed to more than we want to not exercise or to not stick to a diet. As you will learn you are tempted to overeat or eat the wrong things out of response to a feeling, even if you are not aware of that feeling. The desire to distract from that feeling becomes stronger than your desire to stick to your weight loss goals. Thus you continue to cycle of yo-yo dieting, or starting an exercise program then just quitting. Hypnosis can end this conflict so you can maintain healthy eating habits, and exercise. Wouldn't it be nice if your mind supported your efforts instead of undermining them?
      </p>
      <h2>
       5. Eliminate False Hunger
      </h2>
      <p>
       Most of the food consumed by people wishing to lose weight is consumed when they are not physically hungry. Over time people begin to associate the physical sensations of emotions (which we call feelings) to being hungry. For example some people might get a feeling in their gut which they confuse with real hunger. These feelings and this behavior becomes almost automatic because the subconscious mind associate these feelings with hunger to protect us from remember or recalling unpleasant emotions. By using advanced hypnotic techniques we can eliminate false hunger, this reducing the amount of food consumed, all without conscious effort.
      </p>
      <h2>
       4. Reduce Physical Hunger
      </h2>
      <p>
       We can reduce true physical hunger by helping our clients reduce stress. Stress contributes to physical hunger. In the physiology of the body, when stress levels goes up our liver releases more sugar into our body. This release of sugar is used to drive the fight or flight mechanism, to give us the energy to deal with a truly dangerous situation. But in our society if you are cut off in traffic or overworked, there is no way for this sugar to be burned off naturally. So when that sugar isn't used your body then releases insulin. Insulin is the hormone the body releases to store that sugar back into the body's cells. That unused sugar is then stored in our body cells, causing us to gain weight. Another byproduct of that insulin release is that an increase of insulin in our body causes physical hunger. If we were in an actual fight or flight situation, we would need to replace that used energy. But being stressed now that insulin release makes us physically hungry causes us to eat more. This cycle put together with unchecked stress can cause us to eat more than we really need to. Hypnotherapy allows our clients to better handle stress by helping eliminate the emotional cause of stress, and teaching our clients better relaxation techniques.
      </p>
      <div class="content-img right">
       <img alt="No Need to Force Exercisse" src="/img/articles/hypnosis/10_things_weight_loss/running.png"/>
      </div>
      <h2>
       3. Effortless Exercise
      </h2>
      <p>
       Hypnosis can help increase one desire to exercise. Using hypnosis we can help eliminate any blocks or barriers one has to exercising. If you to look at how a lot of people view exercise, you wouldn't want to do it either. Some people view exercise as tortuous, time consuming, painful, humiliating. However you view exercise we can just simply help you make it something that you just do. In fact I once had a client who used to view exercise as a competition. He had to go father, harder, and see the amount of calories burned exceed the amount he did yesterday or else he would be a failure. Every time he didn't top what he did the day before he would feel like a failure, and thus quit exercising regularly until he worked up his will power to do it again, usually months later. We transformed his view of exercise and now it's just something he simply does, and enjoys.
      </p>
      <h2>
       2. Easily Maintain Healthy Eating Habits
      </h2>
      <p>
       Using hypnosis we can help you eliminate false hunger, and even reduce real physical hunger. By doing this it because easy to only eat when you are really physically hunger and to make good healthy choices. In fact you can still continue to eat the foods you love, because by neutralizing those feelings that caused you to over eat in the past, you will no longer have the desire to over eat thus you will reduce the amount of calories you intake naturally.
      </p>
      <div class="content-img right">
       <img alt="Improve The Way You Feel" src="/img/articles/hypnosis/10_things_weight_loss/victory.png"/>
      </div>
      <h2>
       1. Improve the Way You Feel
      </h2>
      <p>
       A lot of time times people figure that will begin to feel better about themselves after they lose weight. In most cases we find that the opposite is true. We find that improving a person mood and how the feel about themselves helps them lose weight. Consider those people who undergo plastic surgery to correct a perceived flaw, and after that flaw is corrected, they still aren't happy. People begin to fall into this trap that if only X happens than I will be happy. Then when X happens, then they need Y to happen in order to feel happy. In number of cases weight loss isn't about what you eat, but its about what's eating you. It is these emotions and the way a person feels about themselves which leads to over eating, not exercising and all things that contribute to keep the weight. By helping our clients feel better, maintain healthy eating habits and exercising regularly just naturally falls into place.
