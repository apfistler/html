      <p>
       You may now be considering if you should use hypnosis to lose weight. I have help many of our clients become successful with their weight loss goals by addressing their individual needs. But now you are standing at a fork in the road of your life. It is up to you do decide if you should continue what you've been doing in regards to maintaining your weight. It's time to consider all of the concerns that being overweight brings into your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The road of being overweight and not maintaining a healthy body is a slow downward road. You could just coast down. It's the path of continuing to do what you have been doing for so long. But it's a path of misery it means carrying all the concerns of being overweight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The road of achieving and maintaining a healthy body will take a little bit of effort but it is the way to freedom, health and life. It is the road of being in control of your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the road of being overweight, it means carrying around with you all of the problems associated with being overweight longer than you already have. Think about how bad being overweight makes you feel. Feel the weight of the burden of this self-destructive behavior. Now you can begin to feel your desire to be free from the ill-affects of this behavior.
      </p>
      <div class="content-img left">
       <img alt="High Road / Low Road" src="/img/articles/hypnosis/hrlrwl/hrlr_web.png"/>
      </div>
      <p>
       You can begin to look down the road of being overweight a whole year. There you are after one more year. Another whole year of being out of control. You begin to feel the weight of the disappointment in yourself. You notice the things that little this painful road. The candy wrappers, the second helpings, the portions that were too large which made you too large. You see the broken promises, The broken promises you made to yourself. Promising to get into shape, promising to diet. Feeling the frustration of using the wrong tool, will power, progressing and then slipping. Making a few strides of weight loss then back sliding. It's as if there is a mirror there and you can looking in it and ask your self, "Am I pleased with having another year of being overweight? Do I feel healthier or worse? I am happy with myself for being overweight for one more year?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you look further, five more years of struggling, of being out of control. Five more years of broken promises. Five more years of frustration. You feel all the affects of that choice of being overweight for five more years. You feel hopeless. Again you look around and see all of the things associated with being overweight. The candy wrappers, the second helpings. The frustration of wanting to do something but not knowing how. You look at all these things now and you can't stand the sight of them. You may even ask, "Am I please with myself for being overweight five more years? Do I have the right to do this to myself? Am I healthier for having made this choice? How is it affecting my health. Is my life better or worse?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you can see yourself after ten more years of being out of control. Brining forth all of the affects of this choice. You look back and you know you promised yourself ten years ago that you would get into shape. You begin to really feel the frustration of wanting and trying, losing weight and regaining more and more. You being to really feel the affects of this decision. You look around and again see all the things that litter this road. The candy wrappers, snack food, second helpings, portions that were too large. You see them and you can't stand the sight of them any more. Look in the mirror there, see your self and ask yourself, "Am I please with being overweight for ten more painful years? Is my life better or worse? Do I feel smarter?" Really feel the consequences of remaining on this low but easy road.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now you can feel better because none of that has happened yet, and it doesn't have to. You decide not to let that happen to you. You have decided to take the high road. The high road of maintaining a slim healthy life style. You know that it will take a little bit of work but you now know in your heart and in your mind that it is worth it. Working with a skilled hypnotist will allow you to achieve the kind of success you have only dreamed about. You now know you no longer need the disappointment and frustration associated with trying to out will your weight loss problem. You can now begin to see the ease of using the power of your mind for you benefit. By using hypnosis you now can finally get past the part of you that says "Yeah right" every time you want to lose weight. You are now able to get the part of yourself that worked against your goals on your side. You can finally now eliminate those painful emotions that lead to false hunger and now you can see the color of your confidence grow brighter and brighter inside of you. You now see the hope. You know now that working with a skilled hypnotist, he or she will guide you and allow you to achieve your weight loss goals. You understand now that hypnotherapy is a process.
