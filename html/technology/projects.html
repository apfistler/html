       One of my proudest endeavors has been the creation of the Adam Fistler Services website.

      <h3>
       The Challenge
      </h3>
      <p>
       I intentionally embraced the challenge of crafting every design element from scratch. This decision stemmed from a desire to showcase my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While the website draws inspiration from my earlier work on the Baltimore Hypnosis Center's website, which I founded in 2006, every line of code — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — is a testament to the challenge of designing this website from the ground up.
      </p>
      <h3>
       A Touch of Collaboration
      </h3>
      <p>
       Acknowledging the power of collaboration, I sought assistance from ChatGPT. This AI tool played a pivotal role in handling generic code efficiently, providing valuable insights, and streamlining certain aspects of the development process. However, as any seasoned developer knows, while ChatGPT can be a powerful ally, it's crucial to approach its output with a discerning eye.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Crafting Complexity
      </h3>
      <p>
       Web development is not just about generic code; it's about addressing complex challenges head-on. In the process, I learned to navigate the intricate landscape of debugging, fundamental development, and bespoke design. Some of the code generated by ChatGPT sparked interest, occasionally revealing quirks and bugs. In such instances, my role was to design solutions independently and then collaborate with ChatGPT to refine and polish the final outcome, aligning it with my unique project requirements.

       Embracing the Canvas: Navigating the Challenges of Learning Paint.NET in Website Design
      </h3>

      </figure>
      <p>
       Learning Paint.NET presented a formidable challenge when embarking on the journey of website creation. As someone whose relationship with art had been distant and uneasy throughout life, the prospect of manipulating images was both daunting and terrifying. The necessity arose to delve into image editing for the website's visual elements, and Paint.NET emerged as an enticing option, offering a robust set of features and being freely available. Initially grappling with the basics, I turned to various resources, including YouTube tutorials and online forums, gradually gaining a foothold in understanding Paint.NET's functionalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The initial struggle evolved into a rewarding process over time. Through a combination of perseverance and exploration, I successfully crafted my website's logo by amalgamating disparate elements found online, subsequently modifying them to align with my vision. As the website expanded, so did the demand for image manipulation, whether it was editing stock images to fit my aesthetic or creating visuals from scratch. While some of the images on this site originate from stock sources, many have undergone significant modifications using Paint.NET to fulfill specific purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Navigating the learning curve of Paint.NET has allowed me to grow more at ease with image creation and editing, enabling the seamless integration of tailored visuals into my web projects. The journey has not only enhanced my proficiency with this tool but has also instilled a newfound confidence in utilizing artistic elements to convey my ideas effectively.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Conclusion
      </h3>
      <p>
       The Adam Fistler Services website is a testament to my commitment to both craftsmanship and innovation in the world of technology. It reflects not only my technical prowess but also my ability to blend AI assistance with hands-on problem-solving. As you explore this site, I hope you appreciate the meticulous effort that went into creating a platform that mirrors my passion for web development.

       Cinnamon
      </h2>
      <p>
       In parallel with my web development ventures, the evolution of my own generic static website generation tool, aptly named 'Cinnamon,' unfolded. Initially conceived as a straightforward Python script, 'html_gen.py,' its purpose was simple: amalgamate the main content of an HTML document with a template and menu. This involved basic text replacement, using strings like
       <!--CONTENT-->
       and
       <!--MENU-->
       in the template.
      </p>

      <h3>
       Simple Beginnings
      </h3>
      <p>
       Cinnamon began as a pragmatic solution to streamline content creation, sparing me from the tedious task of duplicating common elements across every HTML page. However, as any seasoned developer can attest, there's no such thing as a throwaway script. Scripts have a tendency to grow and evolve.

       During a reflective moment on a walk, the name 'Cinnamon' materialized in my mind, and it stuck. As the tool expanded, so did its capabilities. Cinnamon grew to handle multiple sites, diverse templates, and introduced features such as reading configuration YAML files for site information, including name, address data, email, phone numbers, and menu generation data.

      <p>
       To address the intricacies of site management, I integrated a metadata file for each content HTML page. This file encompasses categories, page title names, keywords, and even manages complex HTML structures. For instance, the articles table on my page is dynamically generated from data in the site's metadata YAML file, allowing for easier maintenance and updates.
      </p>
      <h3>
       The Future of Cinnamon
      </h3>
      <p>
       Looking ahead, the future of Cinnamon involves a significant refactor. The goal is to create a system of cascading objects that handle different sites and subsites while abstracting complex HTML structures into repeatable, definable code snippets. This separation of data and design code facilitates easier management and customization.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Cascading Sites and Assets
      </h3>
      <p>
       In the envisioned future, Cinnamon will support cascading sites. The master configuration will contain generic metadata information applicable to all pages, along with a catalog of CSS and JavaScript files to be included across the entire site. Each page within the site will have its own metadata file, enabling further customization and overrides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, the concept of assets will be introduced, allowing for a comprehensive catalog of assets, including CSS, JavaScript, and images. For instance, incorporating an image in any page of the site can be as simple as specifying
       <!--flower.png caption="Flower" -->
       , allowing Cinnamon to intelligently locate and include the image.
      </p>
      <p>
       These advancements aim to streamline and enhance the development process, making the creation and maintenance of websites more intuitive and efficient.

       As it stands, Cinnamon is well-suited to my particular requirements. However, I acknowledge its potential to extend its utility to a broader audience. The code, in its current state, is available on GitHub for anyone who might find value in its functionality. While it caters significantly to my unique needs, the ongoing process of refactoring and making functions more generic holds the promise of making Cinnamon adaptable to a wider range of web development projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       In its present form, Cinnamon aligns with my vision of simplifying site management, especially for projects involving sites with intricate subsites. As I continue to refine the code, the goal is to create a more generic tool that separates HTML coding from data, making complex HTML structures repeatable through configuration files. I envision Cinnamon becoming a valuable resource for individuals and businesses alike—especially those managing complex site architectures or seeking to simplify their HTML structures.
      </p>

       TxFX – Public Environment Configuration Script
      </h2>
      <p>
       TxFX is a PowerShell script that proves increasingly useful every day. It began as a configuration script for setting up public PCs, such as those in public libraries, and configuring my development environment. I initially created it for a web-based application, designed to process printed incident tickets and import them into an electronic database. TxFX facilitates the installation of local copies of Python and Git on public machines, overcoming the challenge of lacking admin access on these devices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally named "Ticket Fix," TxFX has become my go-to script for efficiently configuring a development environment on public PCs in just a few minutes. Over time, I've expanded its capabilities to include handling Paint.NET, an essential tool for creating and editing images in web development projects.
      </p>
      <h3>
       The Future of TxFX
      </h3>
      <p>
       Currently, I am enhancing TxFX to handle a configuration file, defining the configuration data for desired applications. The ongoing modification aims to make the installation process more generic, accommodating various applications through '.exe' installers or '.zip' files that can be extracted locally. This approach allows for easy additions to the config file for installing other applications. Below is an example of the configuration file structure:
