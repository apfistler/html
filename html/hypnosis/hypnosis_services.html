                    As you browse the pages of my website, I am sure you are excited about the services I offer. 
                    But I need your help in launching my business. 
                    On my journey of transformation, I find myself at a pivotal point in emerging from homelessness.
                    By launching this business, this is my way of transitioning out and, in turn, being able to use my extensive skillset and knowledge to help others in their struggles and with everyday problems.
  		  You can help me by reading my 
  		  <a href="/html/go_fund_me.html">Request for Funding and Equipment</a>
  		  , which will help ensure that I can launch my business and provide help, entertainment, and education to everyone.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Office Space</strong>:
                        If you are located in the South Jersey or Philadelphia area and have a small office or office space available
                        that you would be willing to share on a temporary basis until I start generating revenue, I would greatly appreciate your support.
                    </li>
        
                    <li>
                        <strong>Laptop</strong>: 
                        I need a functional laptop, either PC or Mac, capable of running web browsers and office applications. 
                        This will be my primary tool for client interactions and business operations.
                    </li>
        
                    <li>
                        <strong>Printer</strong>: 
                        A decent printer, preferably laser, is necessary for printing business documents and creating promotional materials. 
                        This is vital for maintaining professionalism and providing clients with necessary information.
                    </li>
        
                    <li>
                        <strong>Web Hosting and Domain Name</strong>: 
                        Reliable web hosting is essential for my website and applications. Currently, I'm utilizing an Amazon EC2 Linux free trial server, which has limitations.
                        I need a Virtual Private Server (VPS) for hosting my website and a development environment for my applications. 
                        Additionally, I require a registered domain name to enhance the visibility of my website in search engines like Google.
                    </li>
        
                    <li>
                        <strong>Office Desk</strong>: 
                        An office desk is crucial for organizing my workspace and conducting client consultations. 
                        It provides a dedicated area for paperwork, laptops, and other essential tools.
                    </li>
        
                    <li>
                        <strong>Recliner and Office Chair</strong>: 
                        Once I have my office space, a recliner will be essential for client comfort during sessions.
                        Additionally, I need a comfortable office chair for my desk to ensure I can work efficiently.

       During your first hypnosis session, my hypnotist goal is 
  
            to prepare you for success throughout the entire hypnosis process. 
  
            Your first session builds the foundation of success that carries
  
            through throughout the entire process.  I will first 
  
            guide you into a deep state of hypnosis.  I know
  
            exactly how to determine that you are going into hypnosis and 
  
            he knows exactly what to do to guide you into that state. 
  
            After you have achieved a deep level of hypnosis, 
  
            I will demonstrate to you that you are in hypnosis. 
  
            I will convince you that you are in hypnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       After you have achieved a deep level of hypnosis and 
  
            I have demonstrated to you that you are in hypnosis,
  
            I will begin building the foundation of 
  
            the hypnotic process.  I will use the information
  
            gathered from you input to craft powerful hypnotic suggestions
  
            that will begin to alter the behavioral aspect of your issue. 
  
            I will begin to work on the behavioral aspect of
  
            your problem and let your mind begin to work in a new direction
  
            towards success.
      </p>
      <p>
       After you emerge from your first session, I 
  
            will review with you how the session went and gather your input. 
  
            Your hypnotist will also ask you to start be aware of your issues
  
            and what changes take place, and what challenges still exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you arrive for your second, and each subsequent session 
  
            afterwards you will be greeted and   
  
            will review the previoms week, 
  
            starting at the end of your last session.  I will
  
            ask you what's been going well, and what challenges are still there.  
  
            Based on this information your hypnotist will craft your 
  
            session.  During these sessions I will work on 
  
            the behavioral, mental, emotional and physical aspects of your problem 
  
            until you have achieved the result you desire.  As each session
  
            progresses you will begin to feel powerful change.
