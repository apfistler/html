       You might know or have heard of someone who has received results by using hypnosis.  
            You may even be considering using hypnosis to lose weight, stop smoking, overcome a 
            fear or to obtain another result.  Even though you are considering the benefits of 
            hypnosis, you begin to wonder, "Does hypnosis really work?" or maybe you think, 
            "I have tried everything!How can hypnosis help me with this?"
            After trying so many different ways to get the result you want, 
            it's easy to become skeptical when considering a new approach to an old problem.  
            As you begin to open yourself and start to learn what hypnosis really is, you 
            might find yourself becoming fascinated as you discover all the ways you can use 
            hypnosis, and how the mind works.  You may even become amazed as you learn why what 
            you have done in the past to accomplish your goal has not worked, or wasn't long lasting.  
            When you discover what's possible, you will agree that hypnosis is the right choice for you.

       What is Hypnosis?

       </img>
      </div>
      <p>
       To answer the question, "Does hypnosis work?", you must first understand what hypnosis really is.  
            If you are like most people, most of what you know about hypnosis comes from Hollywood.  While they
            may be entertaining, most of what you see on TV, in the movies or read in a novel simply isn't true.  
            Consider a few movies that has a portrayal of your profession.  Was that portrayal accurate?
            Ask anyone who has worked around computers.  They know that Hollywood's portrayal of computers is 
            far for accurate.  Now take what you know about hypnosis, and set it aside and open yourself as 
            we set aside common misperceptions people have about hypnosis and learn what hypnosis really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hypnosis is the optimal state to make changes in your life.  Imagine setting aside that part of 
            you that keeps you from making the changes you want.  Set aside that part of you that nags at you, 
            and tells you that things aren't possible.  Set aside that part of you that keeps you from 
            accomplishing the things you want.  When you do hypnosis with us, you can set that part aside.  
            That part is called the critical factor.  It's the part of you that keeps you from changing.  
            It's the part that re-enforces limiting beliefs the part that keeps you stuck.  We set that
            aside when we do hypnosis.  We do this by the establishment of acceptable selective thinking.  
            The establishment of acceptable selective thinking simply refers to the process of guiding
            someone into hypnosis by using a hypnotic induction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hypnosis is not mind control.  This popular misconception has been popularized via movies and TV.   
            As we discussed above, the hypnotic state is achieved by the establishment of acceptable selective
            thinking.  That means that suggestions being given must be acceptable to you, the client.   
            That means at any time during a hypnosis session, if there is a suggestion given you don't like,
            you can either simply disregard the suggestion or you may even emerge from hypnosis.  
            Hypnosis is a state of inner focus and control for you, the client.  You can begin to feel confident
            that in hypnosis you have control of what you accept or what you reject.
      </p>
      <p>
       In hypnosis, you are awake and aware.  Hypnosis is not a form of sleep.  The thought of hypnosis 
            as sleep can be traced back to Dr.   James Braid back in the mid 1800s.  James Braid was a physician
            and surgeon.  He observed that eye fatigue, starting at an object to tire the eyes, induced hypnosis.  
            From this he theorized that hypnosis was a sleep like state.  Thus in 1843, Dr.   Braid coined the 
            term hypnosis.  Hypnos is the Greek word for sleep.  After later realizing that hypnosis wasn't a form 
            of sleep, he tried to change the name to be more descriptive.  He chose the word monodeism, meaning 
            a single focus, but it was too late and the term hypnosis stuck and it has been used ever since.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
       Hypnosis is not sleep.  In hypnosis you are awake and aware.  In hypnosis you are aware of all the
            suggestions being given and you are in control of what you accept and what you reject.  
            When you emerge from a hypnosis session, you will be aware of what happened.  The belief that you 
            will not remember anything about your hypnosis session is simply not true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hypnosis is not a truth serum.  Since you are awake, alert and in control, no one, not even your 
            hypnotist can compel you to reveal anything that you don't want to reveal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hypnosis is not relaxation.  Hypnotists commonly use relaxation as a doorway to entering the 
            hypnotic state, however being relaxed does not equal being in hypnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       All hypnosis is self hypnosis.  Hypnosis is a state that you must enter into yourself.  
            Your hypnotist is more like a guide or a coach.  In order to enter into the hypnotic
            state and achieve the results you want, you must have a willingness to follow your 
            hypnotist's instructions.  Your hypnotist has the training and experience and 
            knows exactly what to do to help you achieve your goal.  However hypnosis is like a dance,
            it requires the cooperation of both the client and hypnotist, you can't dance very
            will if your partner is not willing to follow your lead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that you know what hypnosis really is and know the truth about the common misperceptions 
            that people have about hypnosis, you can feel safe and confident that hypnosis is the right
            choice for you.  However hypnosis is not a magic pill.  It takes a special type of person
            to be a good candidate for hypnosis.  It takes someone that is committed to accomplishing 
            their goal, it takes someone who is willing to follow the hypnotist's instructions
            and it takes someone who is ready to make that change.  Are you ready to achieve what
            before you could only dream about accomplishing?

       Can I be Hypnotized?

       You may still object, "I can't be hypnotized.  " or maybe you even said,"I'm too smart to be hypnotized.  " 
            These are common assertions but they come from a misunderstanding of hypnosis .  You have been 
            hypnotized many times before, even though you may not be aware of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I can't be hypnotized.  "If you have ever watched a TV show, or read a book and gotten absorbed into it, 
            maybe it was because you were hooked and just couldn't wait to find out what happens next, but what ever 
            it was you were drawn in.  Or if you have even driven a car, and got lost in a though or in a day dream,
            then all of the sudden you look up and you've missed your exit, or not sure of where you are, or even 
            wonder how you got where you are you were in hypnosis.  If any of these have even happened to you, 
            you have already been hypnotized and are quite capable of being hypnotized.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm too smart to be hypnotized.  "Being hypnotizable has nothing to do with your level of intelligence.  
            What this usually means is that I'm too smart to let people control me.  This is a misperception that
            hypnosis is a form of mind control.  As we've discussed above, hypnosis is not mind control.   
            You are the one who has the control of whether or not you want to proceed with your session.  
            All that is required to do hypnosis is the ability to follow instructions, the willingness to follow 
            those instructions and a desire to change.  Ask your self, "Can I follow instructions?"
            If you answered "Yes" then you can be hypnotized.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may have heard that only a certain percentage of people are hypnotized.  This is true for hypnotists 
            that rely on lengthy old fashioned hypnotic inductions.   This used to be the case in the past when there
            was less of an understanding about hypnosis.  This assertion is no long true.  A hypnotist that is
            trained in the latest and most advanced techniques can hypnotize any willing candidate that
            is ready to follow instructions.

       You now know that you are quite capable of doing hypnosis.  Being in the hypnotic state is much like that
            inner focus of watching TV or daydreaming.  Since you may not even be aware that you are in hypnosis, a 
            skilled hypnotist will convince you and show you that you are in hypnosis, so that you may receive
            your maximum benefit.  You do hypnosis all of the time, you are good at it.  
            Are you ready to use hypnosis to improve your life?

       What Does Hypnosis Feel Like?
      </h1>
      <p>
       Hypnosis is a state of inner focus that allows you to make the inner changes to improve you life.   
            Hypnosis by itself really doesn.  t feel like anything, any more than daydreaming or watching TV 
            feels like anything.  Hypnotists commonly use relaxation as a doorway to entering the hypnotic 
            state so it may feel relaxing.  However everybody's experience is different, some people feel lighter, 
            some people feel heavier, some people feel floaty, and some people don't feel any differently.  
            Your hypnotheapist knows exactly how to determine if you are in hypnosis and knows how to
            show you that you are in hypnosis.

       What you have done in the past hasn't work.  You've gotten all of the information you could find about 
            the problem you want to overcome.  You've received the well meaning advice from your friends and family.   
            If you wanted to lose weight, you hear all you have to do is cut back on your eating, or just walk a
            little bit each day.  For smokers it could be "My uncle went stopped cold turkey, why can't you?", or 
            "Try the gum, or patch.  "Some people even tell you that you have no "will power" or "self control".   
            You hear the advice and each time you hear it you become more and more frustrated.  
            If it was as simple to do as that, you would have done it already.  Maybe you even made up your mind,
            and thought this was really the time I was going to lose weight, stop smoking or break that bad habit.  
            So you make up your mind and stick to it.  You may find that you are able to start losing a bit of weight, 
            or stop smoking, for a short time but then it all comes back.  After so many times of making up your mind
            you just give up hope, you figure I'll just accept the fact that I'm overweight, or I'm going to be a smoker
            and will just live with all the consequences.  You tell yourself that you are happy and that you accept yourself
            as you are.  But secretly you want to lose that weight, or stop smoking or just break that bad habit.

       The problem is that you are trying to out will the problem.  You are trying to use the conscious mind to 
            over power a belief that is generating feelings from the subconscious mind.  The problem with will power 
            is that it you have to constantly keep thinking about your problem and will power is easily defeated.  
            Will power goes away when you are hungry, angry, tired, lonely or tempted in another way.  Just think of 
            the last time you were really hungry, or saw a piece of cake, candy or something else that you really
            wanted and said "Oh well, I can start that diet starting tomorrow.  "Or when you really got stressed out
            or something happened where you just had to have a cigarette.  Will power takes a lot of though and
            energy to maintain.  Worse yet when using will power you constantly are thinking about the thing you
            want to will away.  The subconscious mind can't process a negative, so all of that time you spend trying 
            to not think about eating or have a cigarette you are actually reinforcing the behavior you want to
            get rid of.  It's like asking someone not to think about pink kittens.  Even people who are successful
            with will power for a time can get complacent and start to slow revert to their old ways because using
            will power alone does not get rid of the cause of the problem.

       Talking about the problem doesn't remove the problem.  It may feel good for a time to talk about 
            losing weight, breaking a bad habit, or quitting smoking or another problem.  You've tried it and it 
            has not worked.  Over and over you friends all tell you the same thing and what has worked for them 
            and in the end it just ends in frustration.  Some people spend years talking about their problem 
            and see little to no results.  You are trying to use the conscious mind to overcome a problem that 
            is stored in subconscious mind.  The conscious mind only focuses on what you are currently 
            thinking about at the time, it's analytical and likes to rationalize.  Consciously you know all the
            things that you should do to overcome your problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       The subconscious mind is where the change needs to happen.  Your subconscious mind stores all of the
            information that you have ever been exposed to in your life, it stores your beliefs and generates feelings.  
            Your critical factor is what prevents you from accomplishing your goal consciously.  It compares what you
            already know and believe about yourself, it lets in and reinforces what you already believe and rejects 
            anything that doesn't match.  It is what keeps that shy person believing that people don't like them, 
            or what keeps some people thinking only bad things happen to them when to all of the world they see good
            things happening or they know that other people like that shy person.  In these cases, the critical factor 
            only lets in the events that reinforce what that person already believes.   
            Through hypnosis we can set asides the critical factor and finally change behaviors, beliefs and habits.

       Imagine, we can help you lose weight without cravings, change the way you view exercise, and remove all 
            of the subconscious barriers that prevent you from losing weight.  You can finally begin to build a real 
            sense of hope that this time it will be for real.  Finally, you will no longer need to focus on dieting,
            because the urge and emotions that caused you to over eat will be gone.  Imagine shifting you view of
            exercise from painful, torture, time consuming, punishment to being enjoyable, natural and easy to do, 
            something that you look forward to doing.  Imagine improving your self-esteem, finally losing that weight
            and being able to do it without feeling deprived.  You can do all of that with hypnosis and more.

       You can stop smoking without feeling stressed out, anxious, sad, or angry.  Some people think of their
            cigarette as their buddy.  We can help you get rid of that buddy and not even miss him.  
            You can do this all without losing weight.  People who quit smoking and gain weight are people who have
            not taken care of the cause of the problem.  Through hypnosis we can take care of those subconscious 
            causes and use powerful hypnotic techniques to break the habit.  You can stop smoking with hypnosis and not gain weight.

         Just about any hypnotist can guide you into hypnosis.  But that's where the similarities between hypnotists end.  
            All hypnosis sessions are not the same.  In order to receive long lasting and even permanent results you must 
            choose a hypnotist that uses techniques to remove the true cause of the problem.  Direct suggestion, 
            just giving suggestions to the client, alone does not remove the problem.  Hypnosis by direct suggestion alone 
            generally tends to wear off and needs to be reinforced often.  This happens because subconscious causes of the 
            problem were not taken care of.  This is why when a smoker or weight loss client that has only undergone direct 
            suggestion hypnosis alone runs up against a stressful situation they revert to their old behavior.  Direct suggestion
            hypnosis sessions are usually just one hypnosis sessions, or hotel hypnosis sessions.  Direct suggestion a foundation 
            of successful hypnosis program, however it must be used in a hypnosis program that deals with the cause of the problem.   
            When the subconscious causes of the problems are gone, your desire to continue your old behavior disappears and 
            your subconscious mind accepts all of the suggestions you want permanently.  
            I customize your sessions to your needs and do whatever needs to be done to help 
            you overcome your problem.  I combine direct suggestion and along with advanced hypnotic techniques, and newer modalities to help you get
            rid of that old useless problem.  Now that you know that hypnosis works, that you can be hypnotized and how it will 
            work for you, give me a call at
