         Welcome...
        </p>
        <p>
         Even if you tried different anger management techniques before and failed, our hypnosis process can help you. I can help you release your anger because I understand anger. I believe that all feelings when they are based in reality. It is how one reacts to a feeling that makes the response to that feeling either good or bad. I have a unique and specialized hypnotic process that doesn.t just give you new techniques to bury your anger, our process releases anger, so you can begin to respond better.
        </p>
        <h2>
         I Understand Anger
        </h2>
        <p>
         All feelings are good. Anger is a good feeling. Anger tells us that something isn't fair and to take action to make the situation fair. In fact there have been many good things come as a result of anger. In fact, our country was founded by a group of angry men, who wanted freedom and felt they were being treated unfairly. Anger is a feeling and all feelings are good when they are based in reality.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is when a feeling isn't based in reality when they begin to cause problems. This can happen with any feeling. For example some people begin to experience feelings of fear that aren't based in reality, so they develop phobias. So now that little spider becomes perceived as a huge threat. This can also happen with anger. Some time long ago, for whatever reason you may have been in a situation where you were treated unfairly and at the time there was nothing you could do about it. Sometimes people remember what it was sometimes they don.t. But over time every time that person got angry it was like pouring that anger into a cup. Every time that person gets angry that cup fills more and more. So every time when that person gets angry that person begins to experience and feel that anger from all those situations in the past where they were anger. So now even in a situation where someone would only be a little bit annoyed, this person feels all that anger from the past as well as the present which causes them to experience it as if the situation was really, really unfair. This is called emotional resonance.
        </p>
        <p>
         When that person feels that angry, they might explode and yell at that person or do things that they might regret. After the situation passes they make a promise that they will never react that way again. But the next time they get angry, all that anger from the past begins to come up again causing them to react in the same way. Each time it happens they put more and more anger into that cup. This makes it easier for that cup to overflow with just a little provocation.
        </p>
        <h2>
         The Hypnosis Process That Really Works
        </h2>
        <div class="content-img right">
         <img alt="Hypnosis That Works" src="/img/hypnosis/anger/calm.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>
         Some people begin to seek out anger management techniques which teach you not to express your anger, but to bury. These techniques work for a while but every time that person buries that anger it fills that cup more and more. Perhaps you have tried some of these techniques and they have not worked. Now that you know, you can begin feel better now since now you can begin to use the right tool to release your anger.
        </p>
        <p>
         The only way to truly become free from anger, and change your reactions to anger is to release anger. Releasing the anger is the only lasting way to bring your reactions in line with what you want. Releasing your anger will now allow you to experience that situation with a view and feeling that is more inline with reality. Maybe you have tried before in the past to release your anger, maybe you heard about forgiving others to do so. Our rapid, process takes 4 to 6 sessions, in less than eight hours of hypnosis you could be free. I have the process that works, let us show you how to do it.
