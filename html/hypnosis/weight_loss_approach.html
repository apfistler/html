       I understand that in order to achieve effective long term weight loss, it requires more than just simple changes in behavior. I understand the complex behavioral, mental and emotional issues that contribute to keeping unwanted weight. Inspired by the teachings of Calvin Banyan, M.A., Certified Hypnosis Instructor, Fellow of the National Guild of Hypnotist, and his 5-PATH approach to hypnosis I have developed a unique approach that not only helps you easily change your behavior but un-plants the negative seeds that drives unnecessary physical hunger, false hunger, the lack of desire for exercise and much, much more. As you continue to read about our approach, I am sure you will become excited at the new possibilities that you may have not yet considered. Incorporating our philosphy and apporach I are sure you will agree that I have South Jersey's most unique approach to getting rid of unwanted weight. Our approach is not to help you lose weight, but to get rid of weight, now and in the long term.

      <h2>
       My Philosophy Regarding Weight Loss
      </h2>
      <div class="conent-img left">
       <img "my="" about="" approach="" is="" loss="" satisfaction"="" src="/img/hypnosis/weight_loss_approach/satisfaction.png" weight=""/>
      </div>
      <p>
       The problem with losing weight is that there is a sense of loss, deprivation, either conscious or subconsciously. When you decide you are going to rid of the weight, once and for all you do it to satisfy your self. Traditional weight loss programs, be it diets or forced exercise programs are about depriving your self. Either depriving your self of the foods you like or making you do a type of exercise program that you aren't comfortable with. There are all kinds of different diets, low carb, low fat, restricted calorie, just about everyone knows about just about all of those diets. Worse yet, 'being on a diet' requires lots of mental attention and focus, once you begin to lose your focus, you find your old habits returning. As you already know, over the long run dieting and exercising without neutralizing the source of false, unnecessary physical hunger or unwanted habits is not easily maintainable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our approach to getting rid of unwanted weight is about satisfaction. It's about both keeping the foods that satisfy you and satisfying the feelings that drive false hunger. You may not have been aware of it but unsatisfied feelings often contribute to the physical feelings people confuse with true physical hunger. Often times a feeling will come up and a person will associate that with being hungry. The feelings can be anything, boredom, sadness, anger, guilt, loneliness, any feeling can drive that false sense of hunger. Once a person feels these feelings, he or she eats and the feeling goes away, at least temporarily. Eating in response to those feelings is just distracting from those feelings. In a short time those feelings will return and thus that person will feel hungry again. This is why some people can eat and feel hungry again a half hour to an hour later. Then he or she will eat something else and distract from the feeling again. Over time, that person begins to feel frustrated. That person will again eat to distract from that feeling of frustration. Over more time that person might begin to feel depressed because what they have tried to do in the past to lose weight hasn't worked, so they're mind is telling them to take a break for a little while. Then they eat out of that feeling of depression. I call this cycle the over eaters rut. Our approach to hypnosis breaks this cycle and satisfies the feelings that cause false hunger, thus eliminating false hunger.
      </p>
      <div class="conent-img right">
       <img alt="Stress" src="/img/hypnosis/weight_loss_approach/stress_person.png"/>
      </div>
      <p>
       Another overlooked aspect of weight loss is stress. Stress contributes to physical hunger. In the physiology of the body, when stress levels goes up our liver releases more sugar into our body. This release of sugar is used to drive the fight or flight mechanism, to give us the energy to deal with a truly dangerous situation. But in our society if you are cut off in traffic or overworked, there is no way for this sugar to be burned off naturally. So when that sugar isn't used your body then releases insulin. Insulin is the hormone the body releases to store that sugar back into the body's cells. That unused sugar is then stored in our body cells, causing us to gain weight. Another byproduct of that insulin release is that an increase of insulin in our body causes physical hunger. If I were in an actual fight or flight situation, I would need to replace that used energy. But being stressed now that insulin release makes us physically hungry causes us to eat more. This cycle put together with unchecked stress can cause us to eat more than I really need to. Our approach to hypnosis allows our clients to better handle stress by helping eliminate the emotional cause of stress, and teaching our clients better relaxation techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
       My approach to getting rid of unwanted weight takes approximately four to six sessions, however everyone is different so certain clients make take longer. Our process is a supplement to a healthy diet and exercise program. This means that any diet within reason will help you lose weight and you must be willing to do some sort of exercise program. This does not mean you have to give up the foods you love, I will help you eat less. In the beginning you will need to make a conscious effort to eat less and enjoy it more and exercise. It is not necessary to follow any type of diet program. However it is best to consult your doctor before you change your diet or begin a new exercise program. It is also a good idea to get a check up from your doctor to determine if there are any physical causes that would inhibit weight loss, such as a thyroid condition or certain medications. Ask your doctor before stopping or changing any medications you are on.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Sessions Structure
      </h2>
      <div class="conent-img left">
       <img alt="Hypnosis Session Structure" src="/img/hypnosis/weight_loss_approach/consulation.png"/>
      </div>
      <p>
       On your first session, I will begin by having you fill out paper work. This will allow use to get a little background information on your situation. I will also then give you a copy of our client bill of rights, privacy policy and explain our code of ethics. After you have filled out your paper work, I will then show you two brief videos. The first video will explain all about hypnosis and answer any questions or lingering doubts that you may have about hypnosis. The second video will explain how emotions contribute to weight gain and how hypnosis will help. You will then be greeted by your hypnotist who will then answer any questions you may still have, and gather a little bit more background information. Our first session deals with the behavioral aspects of your situation. In this session I will help any family training issues in regards to food. These include guilt over not cleaning your plate, taking too much and feeling compelled to eat everything, the quality of the food you eat and much more. I will also target exercise motivation and portion control. After our first session your hypnotist will suggest that you only eat in one place, whether that be the table. He will suggest that you do not eat in the car, or in front of the TV, as distracted eating causes us to eat more than I realize. Your input on the first session will be vital, so it is a good idea to begin to think about the areas of weight loss that are a challenge to you, and together I will address these to help you get on the high road to success.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to realize that our approach to getting rid of weight is a process. Every session builds on the last session. In the beginning I focus on building a solid foundation that is necessary for lasting success. After each session it you will find it will become easier and easier to get rid of that unwanted weight. However it is our aim to give our client's realistic expectations. I find that when our clients have realistic expectations their rate of success is much greater. Although the first session will address a great many issues, you can't expect that everything will be solved after just one session. The first session prepares you for the rest of the process. Before doing this powerful process, it is important to decide whether you are going to stick to and complete this whole process. You can expect that over time that you will begin to achieve your goals, but sometimes people experience what they perceive as set backs. For example they have in mind they want to reframe for eating a certain food, and when they do they think they.re whole week is blown. I want you now to give yourself permission to be human and know that by choosing to do this process that over time, your worst day will become better than your best day is today. Give your self permission to look back and see all the things that you have done that you are proud of. All the little things you do towards you goal adds up to one big difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the second session onward, I deal with the mental and emotional aspects that drive false hunger. Using advanced hypnotic techniques I target and neutralize those feelings, returning your control to be who you want to be. If you are finally ready to get rid of false hunger and over eating, this is for you. I also deal with eliminating and controlling stress, reducing unnecessary physical hunger. I will neutralize all the feelings driving your false hunger; fear, anger, guilt, loneliness, boredom. I will also beck how the behavioral aspect is going and work on any additional aspects that need to be worked on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another important overlooked aspect is weight loss is forgiving your self. The burden of troubling your self with not physically being the way you want, and beating yourself up because of it contributes to the stress that holds on to that weight. I find that once I neutralize the primary causes that prevent you from getting rid of that weight, its helpful to remove any anger or guilt that you may feel towards you self. In doing so you will become self confident, happier and much more in control of many aspects of your life, including your weight. Think about what it will feel like to release that. In our experience this goes a long way.
