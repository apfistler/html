      <p>
       Welcome...
      </p>
      <p>
       Although it may at first seem too good to be true, 
            hypnosis is a proven prcoess that genuinely works for
            weight loss issues.  But I 
            don't stop there.  I work in a very unique weight control
            management program that you will not find anywhere else.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Weight Loss Is Our Area of Expertise!
      </h2>
      <p>
       The majority of individuals who fail to lose weight do
            so because they try to diet and diets only work for a few days.  
            Forcing yourself to control what you eat only causes frustration.
            And when the frustration sets in, old patterns rear their ugly 
            heads and before long you're back to eating all the wrong foods. 
            With our weight management program, you don't have to struggle
            to gain will power because your own mind supports you in 
            eating correctly.  Without even giving it much thought,
            once you participate, you
            start doing things that your body and mind require
            for weight loss success.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Can Hypnosis Work for Everyone?
      </h2>
      <div class="content-img right">
       <img alt="Success" src="/img/hypnosis/weight_loss/success.png"/>
      </div>
      <p>
       Although hypnosis has proven to be a valuable tool for 
            life-changing results, we have just very recently come to
            understand that direct suggestion hypnosis alone only worked
            for about 10 to 20 % of the people who were being hypnotized. 
            Plus direct suggestion alone was only temporary. 
            Through the use of advanced hypnotic techniques, we are able to 
            resolve the underlying issues, which allows me to have a success
            rate of close to 95%.  Recent technology has brought to 
            light that for lasting change, one must apply a specialized
            treatment for weight loss that blends the old technology of
            direct suggestion with new modalities that first removes the 
            reasons for failure.  In essence, once the underlying issues
            are removed, the mind is more able to readily accept the new input.
            By and large, the more therapeutic approach reduces and eliminates
            the aspects of emotional eating which occurs when you feel bored, 
            anxious, frustrated or depressed.  Emotional eating has nothing
            to do with real hunger.
      </p>
      <h2>
       The Most Sought After Hypnosis Sessions!
      </h2>
      <p>
       During your sessions, 
            we focus on ways that help you react to food in a new way.  
            You gain control over your eating habits and food becomes
            your friend.  Finally your long struggle with food will 
            be over and you'll feel more in control than you ever
            had previously.  Before long you'll be looking in the 
            mirror and wondering whatever happened to that person 
            who had a weight issue.
