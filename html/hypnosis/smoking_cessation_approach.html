       In order to achieve effective long term smoking cessation, I have developed two type of smoking cessation programs. I realize that in order to stop smoking and have long lasting even permanent results it requires more than simply addressing the behavior associated with smoking. As you may have already experienced, using will power along is not an effective long term solution. No matter what approach you used in the past, our approach does not just treat the symptoms of the problem like nicotine gum or the patch would do. Our solutions effectively deal with and naturalize the behavioral, mental and emotional aspects of smoking. Only by dealing with all three of these aspects will you achieve long term, even permanent results. As you continue to read, you will learn about our philosophy and approaches to smoking cessation which will provide you with the information you need, to decide if hypnosis is the right choice for you. I believe we have the most effective and thorough approaches to help you stop smoking in all of South Jersey.
      </p>

      <p>
       In order to set realistic expectations as to what you, the client can expect when choosing our smoking cessation programs, we would like to dispel a common misunderstand people have when it comes to stopping smoking with hypnosis. I do not offer any one session smoking cessation programs. In our experience they have proven to be ineffective for creating long term lasting results. Most of the time people usually hear about one session group hypnosis sessions in a hotel, or one or two scripted sessions by hypnotist who does not have a great deal of training in advanced hypnotic techniques. These sessions claim to help you quit smoking, guaranteed. In order for these types of sessions to be effective, the hypnotist has to hit on exactly what you need to quit smoking. In most of these cases there is only about a 10% to 20% success rate. There is no time in these sessions for personal attention, and people can get distracted by others, inhibiting the hypnosis process, or not achieve any significant level of hypnosis. The guarantees that are offered usually are that you may come back and sit in another group session as many times as you would like, how ever often they come into town. Worse yet, even if a person does stop smoking with these type of sessions, the underlying cause has not been dealt with, so the problem will gradually shift into another area of your life, such as gaining weight, or other undesirable behaviors. I offer a personal one on one approach that deals with all of the aspects that cause a person to continue to smoke. I offer effective approaches to smoking cessation, but it takes a willingness to quit on your part, and a little bit of effort. Most of our clients out right quit, or experience a significant reduction in the amount of cigarettes they smoking after the first session, however everyone is different and there are no magic bullets that can guarantee that you will quit smoking after one session. Most likely you have been smoking for a long period of time, we feel it would be unethical to guarantee that you will quit after one session. If you think about that, it makes sense.

       For the Social Smoker

      <div class="content-img right">

      </div>
      <p>
       My first program for smokers is a two session process which helps social smokes. Social smokes are people who have been smoking for less than ten years, typically only smoke in social situations, like at a bar, or out with friends. This program is designed for the social smoker who has tried to quit in the past and was able to do so for about a month or more, and it wasn't too hard to do. This program is designed to give these smokers the extra boost they need to finally quit the habit. I deal with the behavioral aspects of the habit and server any remaining mental ties our clients may have in regards to smoking.
      </p>
      <p>
       On our first session, we will begin by having you fill out paper work. This will allow use to get a little background information on your situation. I will also then give you a copy of our client bill of rights, privacy policy and explain our code of ethics. After you have filled out your paper work, we will then show you a brief video. This video will explain all about hypnosis and answer any questions or lingering doubts that you may have about hypnosis. You will then be greeted by your hypnotist who will then answer any questions you may still have, and gather a little bit more background information. Our first session will allow you to learn about hypnosis and begin to feel comfortable about the process. Together you and your hypnotist will gather information regarding your situation and develop a strategy to help you. Your hypnotist will guide you into a nice state of hypnosis and use methods to demonstrate to you that you are in hypnosis. Then your hypnotist will then proceed in dealing with the behavioral aspects of smoking, based on your input.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you come back for your second session, you will be greeted by your hypnotist once gain. Your hypnotist will ask you how it has been going and determine any problem areas that still exist. Based on your input your hypnotist will help you with those areas. Along with additional assistance with the problem areas your hypnotist will use advanced hypnotic techniques to server any remaining mental connections that you have concerning smoking.
      </p>
      <h2>
       For the Regular Smoker

      <div class="content-img left">

      <p>
       Our second approach to smoking cessation is a therapeutic approach designed to eliminate the behavioral, mental, and emotional ties that our clients have to smoking. This program is designed for those smokers who have been smoking for more than ten years and those smokers who have tried to quit, and when they do they become too emotional. These emotions can be becoming irritable when you can't have a cigarette, become angry, sad or even anxious. This process takes approximately four to six sessions, however everyone is different has progresses at their own rate, so sometimes it make take longer than six sessions. This process is designed for the smoke that gets that feeling like they just have to have a cigarette. I have been very successful at helping our clients, but you must be ready to quit for your own reasons and ready to put forth some effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important for the potential client to understand the emotional ties people develop towards smoking. When you get that feeling that you have to go smoke, what you are really doing is distracting from an emotion. So when you get that feeling, you smoke, and that smoking distracts you from that feeling. Over time you mind begins to associate that feeling with the feeling that you just have to smoke. I know than when man first roamed the Earth there was no cigarettes. So there is no true feeling for smoking, just the association your mind makes over time. After a while, of feeling that feeling and smoking to distract from it, you begin to experience another feeling, frustration. That frustration causes you to distract from the feeling of frustration thus causing you to smoke even more. Even after a while a person more feel overwhelmed causing them to smoke even more. This cycle is what we call the smoker's rut. Using advanced hypnotic techniques we can break this cycle and eliminate the feeling and urges to smoke cigarettes. The use of these advanced hypnotic techniques allows us not to just deal with those feelings, but un-plant the seed causing those cravings to vanish.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first session lays the foundation for success through the process. When you arrive for your first session you will begin by filling out paper work giving me information about your problem. Then you will be shown two short videos. The first video will explain all about hypnosis and answer any questions or lingering doubts that you may have about hypnosis. The second video will explain how emotions contribute to smoking and how hypnosis will help. Then, you will be greeted by your hypnotist who will then answer any questions you may still have, and gather a little bit more background information. Our first session will allow you to learn about hypnosis and begin to feel comfortable about the process. Together you and your hypnotist will gather information regarding your situation and develop a strategy to help you. Your hypnotist will guide you into a nice state of hypnosis and use methods to demonstrate to you that you are in hypnosis. Then your hypnotist will then proceed in dealing with the behavioral aspects of smoking, based on your input.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to realize that my approach to smoking cessation is a process. Every session builds on the last session. In the beginning we focus on building a solid foundation that is necessary for lasting success. After each session it you will find it will become easier and easier to cut down or even quit smoking. However it is our aim to give our clients realistic expectations. I find that when our clients have realistic expectations their rate of success is much greater. Although the first session will address a great many issues, you can't expect that everything will be solved after just one session. The first session prepares you for the rest of the process. Before doing this powerful process, it is important to decide whether you are going to stick to and complete this whole process. You can expect that over time that you will begin to achieve your goals, but sometimes people experience what they perceive as set backs. For example they have in mind they want to stop smoking, and early in the process, when they do slip think they're whole week is blown. I want you now to give yourself permission to be human and know that by choosing to do this process that over time, your worst day will become better than your best day is today. Give your self permission to look back and see all the things that you have done that you are proud of. All people are different; some people quit early on in the process and even forget they ever smoked. Others will have small thoughts about smoking but pass within 30 seconds, while they are still in the middle of the process. Then there are other clients who will have to put forth effort to stop smoking in the beginning. The important thing is to find out what is happening in these situations where you feel like smoking, and report them to your hypnotist. Your hypnotist can then determine what feelings are coming up and neutralize those feelings. Keep in mind that this process can be like peeling an onion; once you get rid of one layer of the problem another appears. Keep in mind that if you stick to the process there eventually will be no more layers.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the second session onward, we deal with the mental and emotional aspects that drive the urges and feelings to smoke. Using advanced hypnotic techniques we target and neutralize those feelings, returning your control to be who you want to be. If you are finally ready to get rid of cravings and be a non smoker this is for you. I also deal with eliminating and controlling stress. I will also check how the behavioral aspect is going and work on any additional aspects that need to be worked on.
      </p>
      <div class="content-img right">
       <img alt="Break Free From Smoking" src="/img/hypnosis/smoking_cessation_approach/victory.png"/>
      </div>
      <p>
       Another important overlooked aspect is smoking cessation is forgiving yourself. The burden of troubling your self with trying all these different methods of quitting contributes to stress that drive and fuel cravings for cigarettes. I find that once we neutralize the primary causes that prevent you from stopping smoking its helpful to remove any anger or guilt that you may feel towards you self. In doing so you will become self confident, happier and much more in control of many aspects of your life. Think about what it will feel like to release that. In our experience this goes a long way.

      <p>
       As you can see, our approach to smoking cessation is thorough and complete. By eliminating the behavioral, mental and emotional aspects to smoking, we can help you achieve long last and even permanent smoking cessation, without creating a new distracting behavior such as gaining weight. I believe if you are willing to work with me, letting me be your hypnotic guide we can help you achieve your goal. It takes commitment and a little effort but with your willingness and our expertise you can succeed. Call me today
