                    But I need your help in launching my business. 
                    On my journey of transformation, I find myself at a pivotal point in emerging from homelessness.
                    By launching this business, this is my way of transitioning out and, in turn, being able to use my extensive skillset and knowledge to help others in their struggles and with everyday problems.
  		  You can help me by reading my

                        <strong>Office Space</strong>:
                        If you are located in the South Jersey or Philadelphia area and have a small office or office space available
                        that you would be willing to share on a temporary basis until I start generating revenue, I would greatly appreciate your support.

                        <strong>Laptop</strong>: 
                        I need a functional laptop, either PC or Mac, capable of running web browsers and office applications. 
                        This will be my primary tool for client interactions and business operations.
                    </li>
        
                    <li>
                        <strong>Printer</strong>: 
                        A decent printer, preferably laser, is necessary for printing business documents and creating promotional materials. 
                        This is vital for maintaining professionalism and providing clients with necessary information.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Web Hosting and Domain Name</strong>: 
                        Reliable web hosting is essential for my website and applications. Currently, I'm utilizing an Amazon EC2 Linux free trial server, which has limitations.
                        I need a Virtual Private Server (VPS) for hosting my website and a development environment for my applications. 
                        Additionally, I require a registered domain name to enhance the visibility of my website in search engines like Google.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Office Desk</strong>: 
                        An office desk is crucial for organizing my workspace and conducting client consultations. 
                        It provides a dedicated area for paperwork, laptops, and other essential tools.
                    </li>
        
                    <li>
                        <strong>Recliner and Office Chair</strong>: 
                        Once I have my office space, a recliner will be essential for client comfort during sessions.
                        Additionally, I need a comfortable office chair for my desk to ensure I can work efficiently.

        Welcome...
       </p>
       <p>
        The word 'success' won't even come close to the excitement and powerful transformation 
  
            you'll experience when you allow hypnosis to help you give up the habit of smoking.  
  
            Why?  Because hypnosis is a proven process that permanently eliminates the unhealthy
  
            and unpleasant habit of smoking cigarettes.  Quitting cold turkey or using a patch doesn't 
  
            work because it only shifts the problem to another area.  Often that area is overeating.  
  
            I work with a very unique program that you will not find 
  
            anywhere else.  What makes us different is that I use a method that not only helps you
  
            eliminate the cause, but I also design a strategy that makes use of your spare time more 
  
            productively, so you won't gain weight.   I get to the root of the issue so that you give 
  
            up your addictions permanently.
       </p>
       <h2>
        Will Hypnosis Work For You?
        <p>
         Although hypnosis has proven to work, if you are only attempting hypnosis to please another and are not 
  
            doing it for yourself, it won't work.  You must be committed to yourself and to the program and really want to 
  
            give up cigarettes to reach success.  In fact, I have just very recently come to understand that in order for hypnosis to work, 
  
            it's crucial that a participant must be willing and committed to get to the root of the issue. 
  
            Direct suggestion hypnosis alone only works for a small number of people.  In order to achieve permanent results, 
  
            I use a specialized treatment that blends old technology of direct suggestion with 
  
            a newer and more advanced process that first removes the reasons for smoking.  However, if one isn't 
  
            ommitted to reaching their goals, it's impossible to make the effective changes.
        </p>
        <h2>
         The Two Types of Smokers!
         <div class="content-img right">
          <img alt="Success" src="/img/hypnosis/smoking_cessation/success.png"/>
         </div>
         <p>
          There are two types of smokers, each requiring a different type of plans.  The first is a Casual Smoker.  
  
            These are the people who smoke only occasionally and have been smoking for less than ten years.  More often than not,
  
            these individuals simply need help with the behavioral aspect of smoking and only require very short-term treatment.  
  
            The second type of smoker is the Regular Smoker.  They are the people who have been smoking for a long while 
  
            and smoke on a daily basis.  Generally speaking they are the smokers who become irritated, angry, stressed or
  
            frustrated when they can't smoke.  Treatment for Regular Smokers may require approximately six sessions to see results.  
  
            But by blending the old technology of direct suggestion with the newer modalities that first removes the reasons for the poor habit, 
  
            I are now able to resolve the underlying issue in both situations with a success rate of close to 95%.
         </p>

          Are You Ready To Change Your Life Through Our Powerful Process?
          <p>
           If you've come to a place in your life where you recognize how important it is to take care of your health but you 
  
            have trouble giving up cigarettes, hypnosis is the answer. If you.re tired of the embarrassment of being a smoker, 
  
            sick of the odor of stale smoke on your clothes and fed up with worrying about your health, perhaps your time has
  
            come to take control of this terrible habit.  Did you know that when you reach for a cigarette, very often it's
  
            really a craving for something else?  I at the Baltimore Hypnosis Center help you learn what it is you really want, 
  
            and what your feelings are trying to tell you.  I get to the heart of the smoking habit by severing the mental 
  
            and emotional ties that cause a person to smoke.  Once these ties are severed, the cravings for a cigarette fade
  
            and you're on your way to being a non-smoker.  Stop fighting with yourself to keep away from the cigarettes; 
  
            let us help you stop the urge to smoke.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Gain Control Over Your Habit!
           <p>
            I am very different than other hypnotist in that I offer a custom designed 
  
            program that helps you react to a bad habit in a new way.  I do not use a hit or miss approach and hope that it works.  
  
            Instead I work closely with each client, designing a customized program and determining what the desired outcome will be.  
  
            If you're ready to start life anew, I are ready to help you get there.  By eliminating the cause of the problem,
  
            the old behavior will not return.  Why not give us the opportunity to help you create a life that is more 
  
            satisfying than you ever thought possible.  Call me today at
