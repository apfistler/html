             Just as circles, squares, and triangles are universal symbols, the strokes and formations we use in our handwriting are archetypal too.
             These strokes are the keys to unlocking the enigma of our personality traits.
             The subconscious mind guides our hand, forming letters and lines that signify our goals, motivations, fears, physical and sexual drives, self-esteem, and confidence.
