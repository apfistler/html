         Dear Adam,
        </p>
        <p>
         When we first started these sessions I honestly did not belive that I could feel this way.  I really
                wanted to achieve this goal when I first came to you, but since I have been feeling this way for so long it was hard for me to
                really know how it would feel to NOT have those negative emotions controlling my life.  I am exstatic that you have been able to bring me to see
                my life in a more positive light, and helped me release the bad feelings.  It will help me lead a better, happier life for me &amp; everyone
                around me!  Thank you so much for all of your knowledge that has helped me through this tough part of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sincerely,
         <br/>

        <p>
         I first used hypnosis 6 years ago to stop smoking.  I attended a group session with friends, we were all heavy smokers, now 6 years later I still do not smoke and I have no desire to!  My first introduction to hypnosis was so successful I figured I would try again dealing with weight loss and exercising.  This time my sessions were individual.  I have experienced great success with both my issues.  I feel having private sessions has allowed me to resolve at the very least identify many core issues which have resulted in many of my bad behaviors.  I feel better about myself!  The outcomes are not as important as they were when I first started, because now I feel good and complete, which is what I was really looking for.  I strongly urge anyone seeking to improve themselves to work with hypnosis as you will be fixing many broken parts and pieces from the inside out.  The results are well worth the investment of both time and money.

         I went to hypnosis skeptical like everyone else.  I heard about it but didn't know if it worked.  I tried everything to lose weight before so thought why not.  After I saw the videos I became more hopeful as the last one described me.  I saw little improvement after the first week and got discouraged but wanted to finish it.
        </p>
        <p>
         I did and as the sessions went but I got better and better.  I've learned that by feeling better and helping my self emotionally it became easier and easier.  Now I'm almost all the way there.  I would recommend hypnosis to anyone who wants to change.

         I thought that was going to be easy.  Just close my eyes and I wouldn't want to eat anymore.  Boy was I wrong.  I didn't know how feelings made me gain weight.  I had no use for them before.  But hypnosis showed me how ignoring them hurt me and let me start to take responsibility for my life.  I stopped playing games with myself and got rid of bad feelings now I'm in control for the first time and losing weight.

         Since I have started hypnosis I have felt calmer and more confident than I have in many years.  I do not feel at the mercy of my emotions as much as I used to, and I don't feel like I am automatically wrong for having those emotions.  While I have to stop smoking totally, I have gained a lot besides the ability to be a non smoker.

         I went to hypnosis because I had a hard time sleeping.  It was the most relaxing experience I ever had.  The techniques you showed me helped but getting rid of bad feeling really made it for me.  I never imagined that I could feeling this way and stop questioning myself.  Thanks, I sleep much and am able to relax more.

         Dear Adam Fistler,
        </p>
        <p>
         I have been doing much better recently with confidence and feeling better overall.  Thanks for all your help and time.
        </p>

         I think this will make a big difference in my life.  I remember during the first session we talked about the two different paths I could take in life.  It was an image that really appealed to me and I feel as if I am moving in the right directing and that I am firmly on that path.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am feeling optimistic and excited about reaching my full potential as a person; I am glad to have taken the first steps.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know I will think of more to say, so I will send you and email sometime to let you know how I am.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thanks again,
        </p>
        <p>
